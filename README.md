Tip Prediction Model README
Overview

This repository contains a predictive model designed to estimate the amount of tips a waiter might receive based on various features. The model aims to provide insights into factors that influence tipping in a restaurant setting.
Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes information on several features such as:

    Total bill amount
    Size of the party
    Service quality rating
    Day of the week
    Time of day
    Special events or promotions

Model Architecture

The model is built using a machine learning approach, employing a regression algorithm to predict the tip amount. The chosen algorithm and model architecture are outlined in the Jupyter Notebook (tip_prediction_model.ipynb) included in this repository.
