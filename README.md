## Introduction

Machine Learning is an exciting field, and this repository aims to make it accessible to learners of all levels. Whether you are a beginner taking your first steps in machine learning or an expert looking for new challenges, you'll find something interesting here.

## Projects

### 1. Waiter Tip Prediction

This project is designed for beginners who want to get hands-on experience with regression. The goal is to predict the tip amount a waiter might receive based on various features such as total bill amount, day of the week, and time of day.

### 2. Future Prices Prediction

Another beginner-friendly project, this one focuses on time series forecasting. The objective is to predict future prices based on historical data. It's a great introduction to working with time series data and building predictive models.
